About
------

Similar to [CSS3 Please!](http://css3please.com), this repo will try to make it easier to use css3
in our daily projects. CSS3 Please works fine if you are using vanilla CSS, but for those of us
who are using SASS (or SCSS) it is not enough. With the power of mixins and variables in our hands,
it would be silly to dishonor our addiction to the DRY principle. 

Current status:

* SCSS-file moving against first beta testings.
* No progress on the SASS-file yet.
